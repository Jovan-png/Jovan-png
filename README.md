My name is Jovan Norrington Jr, i'm a software engineering student. Although i've just gotten into software engineering i'm  excited about what i can do and all of the amazing project i'll eventually work on. So far my favorite language is javaScript, only because it allows me to do more with my applications and webpages. I also make gaming youtube videos from time to time its something i've always wanted to do. Thanks for visiting my GitHub Page.
